## Education

I’m now a Master student and a graduate teaching assistant in Communication at [Kent](https://www.kent.edu/comm). I spent four years in [Zhongnan University of Economics and Law](https://english.zuel.edu.cn/mainm.htm) on earning my BA in Bussiness Administration. I was also an exchange student in [National Taipei University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Taipei_University) from 2018 – 2019.

## Who am I

I possess a strong aptitude for self-learning and the ability to marshal resources effectively to achieve my objectives. As a first-generation college student from a quaint town in China, I work hard to be admitted by one of the top universities in China . My parents are both Xiagang workers (the Chinese style of laying off workers). This personal connection inspired me to undertake a project that delves into the silence and communicative practices of xiagang within the family. 

For me, research is not just an academic endeavor; it's a journey of self-exploration.

I am an INFP.   I have a strong associative ability, which always  help me quickly relate one concept to another. I am not satisfied with superficial answers and will dig deeper to understand the core of an issue.



## My research project

Currently, I am collaborating with [Dr. David](https://www.kent.edu/comm/david-e-silva); [Dr. Egbert](https://www.kent.edu/comm/nichole-l-egbert) and [Dr. Zou](https://www.coastal.edu/academics/facultyprofiles/humanities/communicationmediaculture/wenxuezou/) on several topics. This includes **a)** **Online Anti-Pornography Movements**: Using structural topic modeling and discourse analysis, this study examines the sexual scripts present in women-dominated online abstinence communities. b) **Influence of Network Structure on Stigma**: We are examining how network structures influence the stigma associated with gynecological diseases; **c)** **Destigmatization Strategies in Censored Social Media**: This research delves into various strategies for destigmatization within heavily censored social media environments., I have also worked with several master's and Ph.D. students on diverse topics, including algorithmic literacy, the mediated intimacy in astrological videos, and the health anxiety on social media platforms.

## My hobbies

Mountain biking captivates me.  I've embarked on numerous cycling journeys across China, traversing from one city to the next. Every pedal stroke brings with it a synergy, a rhythm, and a profound sense of achievement. 


I have passion for novels, but I'm also drawn to philosophy and accessible sociological research. In 2023, two of my top reads are [Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Women-Data-World-Designed/dp/1419729071) and [Cultural Trauma and Collective Identity](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520235953/cultural-trauma-and-collective-identity).
