## Education

I’m now a Master student and a graduate teaching assistant in Communication at

. I spent four years in

on earning my BA in bussiness administration. I was also an exchange student in Taipei National University from 2018 – 2019.

## Who am I

I possess a strong aptitude for self-learning and the ability to marshal resources effectively to achieve my objectives. As a first-generation college student from a quaint town in China, I work hard to be admited by one of the top universities in China . My parents are both Xiagang workers (the Chinese style of laying off workers). This personal connection inspired me to undertake a project that delves into the silence and communicative practices of xiagang within the family. 

For me, research is not just an academic endeavor; it's a profound journey of self-exploration.

I am an INFP.   I have a strong associative ability, which always  help me quickly relate one concept to another. I am not satisfied with superficial answers and will dig deeper to understand the core of an issue.

, on several topics. This includes **a)** **Online Anti-Pornography Movements**: Using structural topic modeling and discourse analysis, this study examines the sexual scripts present in women-dominated online abstinence communities. b) **Influence of Network Structure on Stigma**: We are examining how network structures influence the stigma associated with gynecological diseases; **c)** **Destigmatization Strategies in Censored Social Media**: This research delves into various strategies for destigmatization within heavily censored social media environments., I have also worked with several master's and Ph.D. students on diverse topics, including algorithmic literacy, the mediated intimacy in astrological videos, and the health anxiety on social media platforms.

## My hobbies

Mountain biking captivates me. There's an undeniable thrill in navigating rugged terrains, with the wind caressing on my face and the challenge of mastering intricate trails. I've embarked on numerous cycling journeys across China, traversing from one city to the next. Every pedal stroke brings with it a synergy, a rhythm, and a profound sense of achievement. 

I've embarked on the self-taught journey of playing the guitar. With just six strings, I've discovered the myriad of stories and emotions that can be conveyed. While I haven't mastered as many songs as I initially hoped, I believe that every chord and note I play brings me one step closer. 

I have a penchant for novels, but I'm also drawn to philosophy and accessible sociological research. In 2023, two of my top reads are '
