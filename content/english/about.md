## Education

I’m now a Master student and a graduate teaching assistant in Communication at [Kent](https://www.kent.edu/comm). I spent four years in [Zhongnan University of Economics and Law](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/zhongnan-university-economics-law) on earning my BA in Bussiness Administration. I was also an exchange student in [National Taipei University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Taipei_University) from 2018 – 2019.

## Who am I

I possess a strong aptitude for self-learning and the ability to marshal resources effectively to achieve my objectives. As a first-generation college student from a quaint town in China, I work hard to be admitted by one of the top universities in China . My parents are both Xiagang workers (the Chinese style of laying off workers). This personal connection inspired me to undertake a project that delves into the silence and communicative practices of xiagang within the family. 

For me, research is not just an academic endeavor; it's a journey of self-exploration.

I am an INFP.   I have a strong associative ability, which always  help me quickly relate one concept to another. I am not satisfied with superficial answers and will dig deeper to understand the core of an issue.



## My research project

I am currently collaborating with [Dr. Silva](https://www.kent.edu/comm/david-e-silva), [Dr. Egbert](https://www.kent.edu/comm/nichole-l-egbert), and [Dr. Zou](https://www.coastal.edu/academics/facultyprofiles/humanities/communicationmediaculture/wenxuezou/) on a range of research topics. These include:

- **Online Anti-Pornography Movements:** Through structural topic modeling and discourse analysis, we are exploring the sexual scripts prevalent in women-led online abstinence communities.
- **Influence of Network Structure on Stigma:** Our research seeks to understand how network structures impact the stigma related to gynecological diseases.
- **Destigmatization Strategies in Censored Social Media:** We are investigating the varied strategies for destigmatization in highly censored social media environments.

Additionally, I've collaborated with several master's and Ph.D. students on diverse topics, such as algorithmic literacy, mediated intimacy in astrological videos, and health anxiety on social media platforms.


## My hobbies

Mountain biking truly fascinates me. I've undertaken many cycling expeditions across China, journeying from city to city. Each turn of the pedal is imbued with a harmonious rhythm and brings a deep sense of accomplishment.

I have passion for novels, but I'm also drawn to philosophy and accessible sociological research. In 2023, two of my top reads are [Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Women-Data-World-Designed/dp/1419729071) and [Cultural Trauma and Collective Identity](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520235953/cultural-trauma-and-collective-identity).
