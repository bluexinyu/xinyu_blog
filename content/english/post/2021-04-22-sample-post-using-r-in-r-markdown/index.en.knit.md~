# Overview

This sample post teaches you my preferred approach for authoring new posts that need to execute R code. The post includes a table of contents and code highlighting. The post content covers interactive HTML tables via the [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) package, static graphs via the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package, and interactive plots via the [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) package.
